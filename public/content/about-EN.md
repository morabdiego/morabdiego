Hi! I’m Diego Mora, an economist and data analyst, {pending dedication}. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Buenos Aires and {current education}.

My experience includes roles in {pending central experience}. Currently, I coordinate the Observatorio Villero at [La Poderosa](https://www.instagram.com/lagargantapoderosa/), where I design socio-economic surveys on issues such as poverty and housing conditions in informal settlements across Argentina. I am also particularly interested in analyzing poverty from a multidimensional perspective and assessing the impact of public policies.

You can get in touch with me and find my CV [here →](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lwOTeUCNgI_H3bU7rwT6sjUkp0IwfIqo/view?usp=sharing) or at the top of this page.
